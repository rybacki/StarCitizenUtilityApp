# Star Citizen Utility App

## Overview

Created out of a personal need to manage game-specific maintenance tasks more efficiently, the Star Citizen Utility App is now shared with the community. It simplifies the process of cache clearing for Star Citizen and your graphics drivers, offers a lookup for the upcoming special Technical Preview event times, and introduces several other new features in the latest release. It may enhance your gameplay just as it has improved mine.

## Features

- **Cache Deletion**: Quickly clear cache files specific to Star Citizen and your graphics driver (Nvidia or AMD), which is especially useful after new game builds or hotfix releases.
- **Server Opening Times**: Check when the Pyro Technical Preview Build server is scheduled to open in your local timezone and get countdowns to the next available play session.
- **Screenshots Management**:
   - List available screenshots in game builds.
   - Delete all screenshots.
   - Remove screenshots from selected game builds.
   - The app automatically detects game builds for convenience.
- **USER Folder Backup and Management**:
   - Create backups of the 'USER' folder for a specific game build.
   - Delete the 'USER' folder from a specific game build or all game builds.
   - The app automatically detects game builds for convenience.
