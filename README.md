# Star Citizen Utility App

## Overview

Created out of a personal need to manage game-specific maintenance tasks more efficiently, the Star Citizen Utility App is now shared with the community. It simplifies the process of cache clearing for Star Citizen and your graphics drivers, and offers a lookup for the upcoming special Technical Preview event times. It may enhance your gameplay just as it has mine.

## Features

- **Cache Deletion**: Quickly clear cache files specific to Star Citizen and your graphics driver (Nvidia or AMD), which is especially useful after new game builds or hotfix releases.
